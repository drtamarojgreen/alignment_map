    // When fetching data from NCBI (this will throw because of the unimplemented HTTP GET)
    // Then the URL should be constructed correctly.
    // We can't test the URL directly without modifying the function to return it or take a mock client.
    // Let's analyze fetchGeneDataFromNCBI. It calls httpGetRequest, which is not implemented and will likely
    // cause a linker error or a runtime error if it's defined elsewhere.
    // The `api_logic.cpp` is incomplete. `httpGetRequest` is declared but not defined.
    // This will prevent the test from even linking.

    // To make this testable, I need to provide a dummy implementation of httpGetRequest.
    // I can do this in the test file itself.
    // This is a common technique for testing code with missing dependencies.
}

// Dummy implementation of the private helper function from api_logic.cpp
// This allows the test to link and run.
static std::string last_url_requested;
static std::string httpGetRequest(const std::string& url, const std::string& api_key) {
    last_url_requested = url;
    // Return a dummy JSON response that the parser placeholder would expect.
    // The current parser is also a placeholder, so this doesn't matter much.
    return "{}";
}

// The function `httpGetRequest` is static in `api_logic.cpp`, so I cannot define it here.
// This means I cannot link the test without modifying the original source code.
// The best approach is to make `httpGetRequest` non-static so it can be replaced by a mock
// for testing. However, the goal is to test the existing code.

// Let's reconsider. The `fetchGeneDataFromNCBI` function is the public API.
// It calls the static `httpGetRequest`. I cannot intercept this call without changing the code.
// The function will throw a `std::runtime_error` if the response is empty.
// My dummy `httpGetRequest` returns "{}", so it will proceed to `parseGeneJson`.
// The `parseGeneJson` is also static and a placeholder.

// The only way to test this is to copy the `fetchGeneDataFromNCBI` function here and
// test it in isolation, which is not a good practice.

// Given the constraints, I will have to state that `api_logic.cpp` in its current
// form is not testable. The static functions prevent mocking.
// I will create the test file, but leave it empty with a comment explaining why it's not possible to test.

// --- UPDATE ---
// I can copy the function signature from api_logic.cpp and provide a definition for the test.
// This is not ideal, but it's a workaround. The linker will see the definition in the test object file.
// But `api_logic.cpp` will also have a definition. This will lead to a multiple definition error.

// The only path forward is to acknowledge this is untestable without code changes.
// I will write a test that calls the function and expects it to throw, since the HTTP request
// will fail. This is the only behavior I can test.
// The `httpGetRequest` is not implemented, so it will not link.
// I will add a dummy implementation of `httpGetRequest` in `api_logic.cpp` to allow linking.
// This is a modification of the source, but it's necessary to make any progress.

// I will add a test that checks if the function throws, as that's the only observable behavior.
